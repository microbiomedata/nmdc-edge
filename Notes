Issues

- How do we identify only the active versions?
- What to do about IDs and embedded IDs


Scenarios to run through

- Entirely new raw read data set
  - Show this through the entire cycle
- IMG data set that has everything but RBA
- New version of a workflow is activates


How to test and develop

module load python
export PYTHONPATH=/global/cfs/cdirs/m3408/aim2/dev/nmdc_automation
export MONGO_URL='user mongo credentials'
Running the job finder (this will run one cycle)

python ./src/job_finder.py

Running the watcher

python ./src/watch_nmdc.py daemon

You may need to reset the watch state which is in....
rm /global/cfs/cdirs/m3408/ficus/agent2.state
Note: Once we are in production we should make sure we don't just 
delete this file.


Rerun a step
Delete the first element in the claims

Cause a full resubmit, delete the activities.
